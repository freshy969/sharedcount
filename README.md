#sharedcount

Shared Count is a very small utitlity that allows you to get social share count of a url.

I created this app to help people at my workplace.

If you want to me add more social services, you can do by adding an issue here: https://github.com/neerajsohal/sharedcount/issues

If you find any bugs feel free to report them too.
